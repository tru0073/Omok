Play Connect 5!


Two players attempt to connect 5 pieces in a row on a 15x15 board. 

Player 1 and Player 2 take turns placing pieces. After a player makes their move by placing a piece down, the script should evaluate whether or not that was a winning or illegal move. If illegal, stop the move. If it was a winning move, end the game and declare the winner.
